My site seems to fit most of the catagories for this project. I think that I used flexbox very well. My site works on both Firefox and Chrome and there seems to be little, if no visual difference in the layout. I set up a series of cascading boxes filled with content, with the condition that it will be easy to add new boxes with only regular, predictable html additions that can be generated serversite programatically without the need for client side javascript. The site removes the boxes on smaller screens, resorting to a linear based layout. I think I may have not used the modernizr script very well, though. I had little way to test it on an older system.
